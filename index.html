                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since complting the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as asoftware Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

            <p class="kira-para">"Before joing the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from proffessionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouragd to enroll by a formal student of their's who can only say wonderful
                things about the program. The entire ciriculum and staff didn't not disappoint. They were always hand-on and I never had to wait for assistance. The agile tam project in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level
                in a way that no tutorial could ever have in fact. I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development expriences. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offer 100%
                recommend!"
